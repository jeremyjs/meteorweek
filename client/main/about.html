          <h3>Learn Meteor in a week. Use it to launch your career.</h3>
          <p>
            When I was first learning Meteor, there weren't a lot of free
            tutorials out there to take me beyond the basics. The goal of
            <span class="brand-inline">Meteor Week</span> is to provide fun,
            engaging beginning and intermediate tutorials to everyone in order
            to propel Meteor into the mainstream. Since Meteor is still rather
            new, and the community is still growing, now is the perfect time
            to start learning and enjoying the power of this truly stellar
            web framework and launch your Meteor apps into the stratosphere.
            <br/>

              One giant leap for the Meteor community.
