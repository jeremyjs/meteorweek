        <h3>Quality Tutorials for a Meteoric Learning Experience</h3>
        <p>
          When I was first learning Meteor, there weren't a lot of free tutorials out there to take me beyond the basics. My goal is to provide fun, engaging beginning and intermediate tutorials to everyone in order to propel Meteor into the mainstream. Since Meteor is still rather new, and the community is still growing, now is the perfect time to start learning and enjoying the power of this truly stellar web framework. I also provide premium, next-level content and support to those looking to launch their Meteor apps into the stratosphere.
