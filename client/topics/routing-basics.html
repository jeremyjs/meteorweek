  <h2> Routing Basics </h2>
  <p>In this lesson, we're going to learn all about Routing. Whenever you type a url into the box at the top of your browser, the website you are trying to access will usually "route" you to some page. <strong>MeteorWeek</strong>, for instance, routes you to the lesson based on the part of the url in the brackets: <span class="code">https://week.meteor.com/topics/&lt;current-lesson></span> In <strong>Meteor</strong>, there is a neat third-party package called <strong>Iron Router</strong> that can handle all of the routing for us. You can give it a "layout" template, which usually consists of the navbar at the top of the page and the footer at the bottom of the page. The layout template can then be reused for some or all of our routes. <strong>Iron Router</strong> can also do other cool stuff depending on the data we give it. </p>

  <p>
  	Let's start off by downloading <strong>Iron Router</strong>. First, you will need to download <a href="atmospherejs.com"><strong>Meteorite</strong></a>, the unofficial package manager for Meteor. You can do that using node package manager: <span class="code">npm install -g meteorite</span> If you don't have NPM, you can get it <a href="npmjs.org">here</a>. Now we can add <strong>Iron Router</strong> to our project with:
  </p>

  <div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-body">
    	mrt add iron-router
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Okay, let's take a look at our new router.
