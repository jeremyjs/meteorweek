        Meteor currently supports Linux and Mac: OS X 10.6 and above. <br/>
        <h4><strong>Meteor</strong> is two things:</h4>
        <h5>A command-line tool.</h5>
        <p>
          Meteor is a build tool analogous to make, rake, or the non-visual parts of Visual Studio. It gathers all the source files and assets in your application, carries out any build steps like compiling CoffeeScript, minifying CSS, building npm modules, or generating source maps, fetches the packages used by your app, and outputs a standalone, ready-to-run application bundle. In dev mode it does all of this interactively, so that all your changes show up in the browser instantly. No refresh required. Out of the box, it's simple and easy, but it's also extensible: you can add support for amlmost any language, compiler, or API just by adding a package to your app.
        </p>
        <h5>An integrated environment.</h5>
        <p>
          There are a dozen core Meteor packages to handle things like HTML templating, which automatically pushes live updates as the data is changed. There are also optional packages like Meteor Accounts, a full-featured user account system that you can drop right into your app. Beyond these official packages, there are hundreds of community-written packages in Atmosphere, one of which might do just what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key idea in the Meteor package system is that everything should work identically in the browser and on the server (wherever it makes sense, of course: browsers can't send email and servers can't capture mouse events). Our whole ecosystem has been built from the ground up to support this.
