      <h5 class="inactive"> Meteor 7.0.1 currently supports Linux and Mac: OS X 10.6 and above, and has unofficial Windows support for Meteor version 6.4.1</h5>

      <h4><strong>Meteor</strong> is two things:</h4>

      <h5>An integrated environment.</h5>
      <p>
        There are a dozen core Meteor packages to handle things like HTML templating, which automatically updates your web pages as the data is changed. There are also optional packages like Meteor Accounts, a full-featured user account system that you can drop right into your app. Beyond these official packages, there are hundreds of community-written packages in Atmosphere, to do anything you might need. Everything in Meteor should work identically in the browser and on the server (wherever it makes sense, of course: browsers can't send email and servers can't capture mouse events). The whole Meteor ecosystem has been built from the ground up to support this.

      <h5>A command-line tool.</h5>
      <p>
        Meteor is a build tool that gives you powerful commands for creating and testing and deploying web applications. Meteor makes deploying to a server as easy as 1, 2, 3. If you really want to experience what sets Meteor apart, try the first few lessons for free.
