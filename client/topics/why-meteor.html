  <h2> Why <strong>Meteor</strong>? </h2>

  <h5 class="inactive"> Meteor <span id="meteorVersion">0.7.1.2</span> currently supports Linux and Mac: OS X 10.6 and above. (There is unofficial Windows support for Meteor version 6.4.1)</h5>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://meteor.com">Meteor</a></strong> is two things:</h3>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;"><em>An integrated environment.</em></h4>
      <p>
        There are a dozen core Meteor packages to handle things like HTML templating, which automatically updates your web pages as the data is changed. There are also optional packages like Meteor Accounts, a full-featured user account system that you can drop right into your app. Beyond these official packages, there are hundreds of community-written packages in Atmosphere, to do anything you might need. Everything in Meteor should work identically in the browser and on the server (wherever it makes sense, of course: browsers can't send email and servers can't capture mouse events). The whole Meteor ecosystem has been built from the ground up to support this.
      </p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;"><em>A command-line tool.</em></h4>
      <p>
        Meteor is a build tool that gives you powerful commands for creating, testing, and deploying web applications. Meteor makes deploying to a server as easy as 1, 2, 3. If you really want to experience what sets Meteor apart, click the button to get started!
